      <h3>Esat Bala</h3>
      <p>Hi, my name is Esat and I'm currently an undergraduate student at City, University of London studying Computer Science. I have had a passion for computer science, cyber security and coding since the age of 14. I have some experience in Python however have never coded in Java before this bootcamp. I found some of the challenges tough but enjoyed the learning process and challenges throughout bootcamp.

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Image Art</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2020). This Processing project demonstrates my understanding 
	of loops, randomness, mapping and the use of images. I created a program that takes an image, finds the pixels colour and position on the sketch and then proceeds to randomly re-draw the image as thin ellipses varying in direction which are looped. The output produces a nice aesthetic which adds texture to an image and makes it come to life. The image I chose to use was a Lion as I thought the texture produced replicated the fur creating a pleasing aesthetic. I can change conditions to vary the output such as the speed of the loop, length of the ellipses being produced and the randomness of the angle the ellipse is drawn in. I have also attached an image of another example but this time using a Whale.
